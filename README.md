# Comparative analysis of the socio-economic and ecological footprint between the European industrial fishing and Maldivian coastal fishing for tropical tuna

This project aims to compare two very different fishing models that target the same species of tuna in close geographical areas with comparable catch volumes:
- industrial purse seine fishing practiced by European vessels (French and Spanish) under fishing agreements between the EU and African countries.
- coastal pole and line fishing practiced by Maldivians

This analysis compares these two fishing models in terms of:
- impact on biodiversity. This is done in particular by analyzing catches of juveniles and the proportion of catches made using fish aggregating devices (FADs), i.e., 
floating rafts that attract tuna but also many other species, leading to high bycatch rates. 
- impact on the climate. A carbon footprint assessment was carried out, taking into account greenhouse gas emissions associated with fishing activity (fuel consumption), 
but also downstream emissions associated with the value chain, such as those associated with maritime freight transport, fish processing into canned products (life cycle analysis), 
and the rotation of European crews by plane several times a year to travel to fishing areas. Finally, the originality of the carbon footprint assessment lies in the fact that it also 
includes emissions associated with the non-sequestration by the ocean of the carbon contained in these fish as a result of fishing, a component that is still largely neglected in this type of analysis. 
- Hoarding of public subsidies. So-called ‚Äúindirect‚Äù subsidies, such as the fuel tax exemption enjoyed by European tuna seiners, have been estimated. We have also included in the analysis 
direct subsidies from European funds that have enabled the development of the European tuna fleet since the 1990s through the construction and modernization of these vessels.

# üìä Data used

The project is based on a cross-referencing of several data sources :
- The socio-economic data from the [STECF](https://stecf.ec.europa.eu/data-dissemination/aer_en), which includes fuel consumption by European tuna seiners, the number of vessels and seafarers, as well as catch data by species and FAO sub-zones. 
- [The weekly oil bulletin](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/data-and-analysis/weekly-oil-bulletin_en), which includes fuel tax rates that do not apply to European vessels, changes over time, and by Member State.
- Spatial catch data from regional fisheries management organizations ([IOTC](https://iotc.org/data/datasets), [ICCAT](https://www.iccat.int/en/accesingdb.HTML) indicating more precisely the fishing ground and proportion of catches taken on FADs.
- Data on the [the size of the fish](https://iotc.org/data/datasets) caught published by RFMOs.
- Outputs from [Ecopath with Ecosim models](https://ecopath.org) to estimate the proportion of tuna caught that would otherwise have sunk to the bottom of the ocean, enabling carbon sequestration.
- [Carbon intensity factors](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/carbon-intensity-electricity) for different countries to take into account differences in energy mix between countries and the fact that some produce more GHG per kWh produced.
